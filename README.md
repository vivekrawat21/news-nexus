# Next.js Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## About This Application

This application is built using Next.js, a React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites. The project is configured to use the experimental `appDir` feature, which allows for a new file-based routing system.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```
Next, copy the environment variables from `env.sample` to `.env.local`:

```bash
cp env.sample .env.local
```
Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
